GUI:

  so that we don't have hardcoded nodetypes when setting default routes. Easier
  creation of new router nodes (e.g. click).
- create branches for student development.
- integrate ipsec GUI implementation.
- add multiple address support for IPv4 and IPv6.
- add GIF interface to the logical interface menu
- divide editor.tcl in multiple files. improve code organization.

annotations:
- select annotation while and after resizing
- layering of annotations
- sometimes a rectangle can't be created.
- undoing resets annotation border color.
- border width can't be zero.
- copy/paste annotations
- keyboard movement of annotations
